                        <p>A commissioned project, this program took me the most time and effort, along with the most
                            iterations to get where I wanted it. The basic idea grew in scope until it hit the point
                            where it currently sits. The GUI allows you to view, edit, add, remove, and overall manage
                            any number of games from any number of sources. Almost all the settings are changeable by
                            the user to ensure the best UX possible. The browser's main purpose is to allow someone to
                            search for games using tags. It also helps make it obvious what is and isn't a favorite, or
                            if a game has been discontinued. It can also pull data from a site on it's own, but only if
                            the advanced options are properly inputted. I love this big ol' program and will continue to
                            push updates as I find better ways to do things.</p>

                        <p>This program builds a command-line command for FFmpeg to convert videos to a preferred
                            format. There are a lot of options I've built into the program over time, including the
                            output video container, as well as support for shorter video types. It either outputs to
                            .mp4, .mkv, or .webm, depending on user input. The intention was to create a simple way for
                            video editors/collectors to convert single files or entire folders of video to the smallest
                            possible size, while retaining the greatest possible quality. I've put it through many
                            iterations to improve upon all aspects, including ease of use, integration for use with
                            shell menus, automatic cropping of black space (still buggy), etc. I still am working to
                            improve this program as I get more test cases that have errors, and am quite happy with it!

                        <p>Ever want a super simple Spotify controller that sits on the taskbar? Look no further! By
                            creating a Spotify instance using PyWinAuto, this program is able to control the main
                            Spotify window without it being visible. It does this by sending the appropriate keyboard
                            shortcuts to the window while it is in a hidden state. The GUI includes buttons for
                            previous- and next-track, pause/play, and even allows you to control volume by scrolling
                            over the GUI. The track name and artist are also visible, and if they are too long, the
                            scroll in a marquee. The program knows the currently playing track by reading the Spotify
                            window title. Overall, this program is able to interact with Spotify without changing or
                            interferring with default playback. Additionally, and optionally, included is an AutoHotkey
                            script that will change the taskbar shortcut for Spotify from the python file to Spotify's
                            executable and back automatically for ease of use.

                            Configuration options and geometry methods are redirected to the appropriate level widget
                            within the main widget. All tkFrame widget keyword arguments are accepted, along with some
                            custom options including padding, automatic updating, and scroll-speed. All internal widgets
                            are saved as attributes for ease of access. This was my first foray into creating custom

                            allow an indefinite number of layers. On the technical side, the chart itself is drawn using
                            matplotlib's pyplot, along with some hackery to ensure the circles are properly drawn.
